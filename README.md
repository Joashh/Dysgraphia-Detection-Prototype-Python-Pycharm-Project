# Dysgraphia-Detection-Prototype-Python-Pycharm-Project
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Our university requires us to create a software with a concept of basic machine learning. You are free to continue my work as long as you will develop it and use it on a good purpose and not just literally copying or imitate my work. My project works by writing your name on the black screen and when you hit 'Lock' then 'Predict' - it will predict whether the input is a potential dysgraphic or low potential dysgraphic. You can upload as well files with .png and .jpg format. </div>
<br>

**Description:** <br>
- Prone to any errors <br>
- Model has 65% accuracy <br>
- Super need to be developed <br>
- 3 features only <br>
- Created by student  <br>
- Supervised Binary Classification <br>

**Steps to run:**
1. Download the zip file and extract to folder
2. Open in Pycharm with Python 3.10
3. The main file is the 'interface2' - this is the only thing you need to run
4. In order for the project to run, you need to install modules including the tesseract that needed to be installed in your device or computers
5. Just follow the error codes for the module requirements
6. Adjust the 'levelness.py' for configuring the feature extraction process and the model
